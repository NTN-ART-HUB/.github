<h1 align="center">Welcome to NTN ART HUB  ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h2>Project Background</h2>
<p>Sri Lanka has a rich cultural heritage and a vibrant art scene, yet many talented artists struggle to gain the recognition they deserve. Despite their skills, these artists often remain unknown due to limited opportunities for exposure. Additionally, the local art community faces significant challenges in obtaining high-quality art supplies, which can hinder their creative processes.</p>

<p>Traditional methods of promoting and selling art are not sufficient to meet the needs of modern artists and art enthusiasts. Art fairs, exhibitions, and galleries, while valuable, are often inaccessible to many emerging artists and do not provide a platform for continuous engagement with a broader audience. There is a clear need for a more inclusive, accessible, and efficient way for artists to connect with potential buyers and for customers to find unique, customized art pieces.</p>

<p>The advent of digital technology offers a solution to these challenges. An online platform can provide a centralized space where artists can showcase their portfolios, customers can commission artwork and art supplies can be easily accessed. This not only bridges the gap between artists and buyers but also fosters a supportive community that encourages artistic growth and collaboration.</p>

<p>By leveraging technology, we can create an art website that addresses these issues, offering a comprehensive solution that benefits the entire art community in Sri Lanka. This platform will not only enhance the visibility of local artists but also make the process of finding and commissioning art more straightforward and efficient for customers. Additionally, it will provide valuable resources and a marketplace for art supplies, further supporting the creative endeavours of artists.</p>
